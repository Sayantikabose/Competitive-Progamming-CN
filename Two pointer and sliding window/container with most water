Container With Most Water
Send Feedback
Given a sequence of ‘N’ space-separated non-negative integers A[1],A[2],A[3],......A[i]…...A[n]. 
Where each number of the sequence represents the height of the line drawn at point 'i'. Hence on the cartesian plane, each line is drawn from coordinate ('i',0) to coordinate ('i', 'A[i]'), here ‘i’ ranges from 1 to ‘N’. 
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most area of water.

Explanation of The Sample Input 1:
For the first case: 
We can create ‘n(n+1)/2’ different containers using ‘N' containers for example with 1st and 3rd line we can create a container of area = (3-1)*min(4,2)=4.

All Possible Containers:  


Lines used          Area
4,3         area=min(4,3)*1=3
4,2         area=min(4,2)*2=4
4,1         area=min(4,1)*3=3
4,4         area=min(4,4)*4=16
3,2         area=min(3,2)*1=2
3,1         area=min(3,1)*2=2
3,4         area=min(3,4)*3=9
2,1         area=min(2,1)*1=1
2,4         area=min(2,4)*2=4
1,4         area=min(1,4)*1=1


But among all such containers the one with the maximum area will be formed by using the first and last line, the area of which is : (5-1)*min(4,4)=16.

Hence we return 16.

For the second case: 
We can take the first and third line to get an area of (3-1)*min(1,1)=2 which is the maximum possible area in this sequence.

    int l=height.size();
    int i=0;
    int j=l-1;
    int area=0;
    while(i<j)
    {
        area=max(area,((j-i)*min(height[i],height[j])));
        if(height[i]<height[j])
            i++;
        else
            j--;
    }
    return area;
    
}
